## **🗓️ Week 2 - Data Engineering Ecosystem**

### **🎯 Main Concepts Learnt**

- There are many data sources, such as
    - Relational databases, XML, flat files, API, Web Services, data streams.
- Three main data structure categories:
    - Structured (Relational Databases)
    - Semi-structured (JSON)
    - Unstructured (Photo or Video)
- Data Engineering Lifecycle (how) is the process of stages involved for the end product:
    - Generation of data → Storage (Ingestion→Transformation→Serving) → 1. Analytics 2. Machine Learning 3. Reverse ETL.
- Data Engineering Ecosystem is a colection of tools, technologies, platfroms used to build and manage infrastructure (what)
- Moden Data Ecosystems:
    - flexible, scalable and faster than traditional ecosystems, while often they make use of cloud computing, big data technologies and machine learning.
- Key components of Data Processing:
    - Step 1: Pull copy of data from original sources to data repository
    - Step 2: Organise, clean, optimise, check compliances
- Roles in Data Ecosystem:
    - Data Engineer - converts raw data into usable data
    - Data Analyst - generate insights from that processed data
    - Data Scientist - builds predictive models from past data
    - Bussiness and Intelligence Analysts - use insights and predictions to make decisions
