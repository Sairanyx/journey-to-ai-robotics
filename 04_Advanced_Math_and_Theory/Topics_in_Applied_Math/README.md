📘 Applied Mathematics for ICT (5 ECTS)

This course develops the mathematical foundations required for computer science, cryptography, AI algorithms, and robotics. The focus is not on memorization, but on formal proof construction, algorithmic reasoning, and mathematical problem-solving.

🔹 Core Topics & Skills

1. Mathematical Logic

- Propositional and predicate logic
- Logical equivalence, normal forms (CNF/DNF), inference rules
- Construction of formal proofs using logical laws and truth tables

2. Number Theory & Cryptography

- Divisibility, GCD, Euclidean algorithm
- Modular arithmetic, residue classes, Fermat’s theorem
- Proof-based cryptographic foundations, including RSA and hash functions

3. Combinatorics

- Permutations, combinations, binomial coefficients
- Counting proofs and combinatorial identities
- Applications to probability and complexity analysis

4. Sequences & Recurrence Relations

- Closed-form solutions
- Mathematical induction proofs
- Series expansions: Taylor and Fourier series (applied in signal processing and ML approximation)

5. Graph Theory

- Graphs, paths, cycles, planarity, trees
- Connectivity and Euler/Hamilton concepts
- Basis for routing, networks, and robot motion planning
