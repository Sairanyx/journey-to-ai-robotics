## 🔷 **5. Identified Challenges (Current State Analysis)**

| --- | --- |
| **Language Barriers** | Most communication is only in Finnish |

| **Lack of Awareness** | Parents unsure how they can participate or if they are even allowed |

| **Event Design** | Current events are child-centered; few activities designed *for parents* |
| **No Multilingual Communication Strategy** | No systematic translation of key messages or invitations |

> 📌 Personal Insight: Based on my analysis and questions, I believe simple improvements in communication and parent roles could have a major impact without increasing costs.
