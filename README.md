# 🤖 Journey to Machine Learning & Robotics - Eduard Rednic

This repository documents my learning journey as I study **ICT Engineering (Data Engineering & AI)** at **Turku University of Applied Sciences (Turku AMK)** in Finland.  

I’m currently in my **2nd year** and created this repo to **track my development, reflections, and selected coursework** as I grow in the areas of **programming, data systems, machine learning, and robotics foundations**.  
Not everything I work on will appear here.

## 🧭 About Me

**Eduard Rednic**

I was born in **Romania**, grew up in **Greece**, lived in **London** and **Scotland**, and now study in **Finland**.  
Moving between countries taught me to adapt quickly, communicate with all kinds of people, and stay open-minded - things that help a lot in international teams and projects.

🎓 **B.Eng. Information Communication Technology - Data Engineering & AI**  
**Turku University of Applied Sciences, Finland**

Before entering engineering, I completed a **B.Sc. (Hons) in Sport & Exercise Science (First Class)** at the **University of Stirling, Scotland**.  
My undergraduate research, *"Normative Data on Regional Sweat Sodium Concentration and Various Self-Reported Ratings in Male Endurance Athletes,"* was a quantitative study combining physiology, data analysis, and applied statistics.  
Supervised by **Dr. Stuart Galloway**, the project analysed data from **2,112 endurance athletes** and helped shape my interest in data and research.  
That experience gave me a scientific mindset and an appreciation for data - skills I now apply to engineering.

I’ve been involved in **high-performance swimming my whole life**, both as an athlete and a coach - first at the **University of Stirling** and now at **Uinti Turku / Åbo Simning**.  
Swimming taught me **perseverance, focus, teamwork, and not giving up once I commit to something** - habits that guide how I study and approach projects today.

## ⚙️ Current Focus (Autumn 2025)

I’m currently completing my **3rd semester**, which includes:

- Databases (5 ECTS)  
- Data Structures & Algorithms (5 ECTS)  
- Basic Skills for Data Management (5 ECTS)  
- Introduction to Data Engineering (5 ECTS)  
- Topics in Applied Mathematics (5 ECTS)  
- SUSTIS Project on Sustainable Development (3 ECTS)  
- Professional Practice (10 ECTS)

In parallel, I work part-time as a **Student Assistant** at the **Autonomous & Intelligent Systems Laboratory (AIS Lab)**, where I’m learning about real-world data platforms and distributed systems.

I’ve also been granted **cross-institutional study rights** at the **University of Turku**, where I plan to take additional courses over the next few years to strengthen my background in **mathematics, robotics, and embedded systems**.  
Additionally, I’m in the process of applying for courses from **Tampere University** to further expand my theoretical skills.

## 🧩 Research & Lab Experience

### 🔹 AIS Lab - Turku AMK - Summer Internship (SAVY Project)
**Period:** May–July 2025 (270 hours)  
**Role:** Research Intern - Autonomous & Intelligent Systems Laboratory, Turku AMK  
**Project:** Environmental monitoring platform for the Archipelago Sea drainage basin and coastal area  

- Worked on a **REST API** used for accessing time-series sensor data stored in **InfluxDB**.  
- Analyzed performance and improved handling of larger data requests using **Celery** and **Redis**.  
- Helped update a **ReactJS** web interface and added small backend features such as **toast notifications, API documentation, and health checks**.  
- Gained experience with **Python, Flask, Docker, PostgreSQL,** and general Linux tools.  

🎯 *Key learning:* Learned how data moves through real systems and how to make backend services more reliable - and how fast time passes when you enjoy what you do.
